# graph
Graph related operations

The goal of writing this piece of code is to further familiarize myself with the GO programmign language. 

djikstra.go implements Djikstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph between 2 nodes. 
This algorithm has not been optimised. It does not detect all shortest paths. It may have bugs.
